This is a Crowdsale Solidity Smart Contract that was made using the Remix IDE / OpenZepplin contracts.
The Crowdsale is for a coin called Pupper Coin, which will be used to track the genetic trail for pet owners.

To deploy the Smart contract:

First Deploy PupperCoinSaleDeployer contract in Remix
Take note of the token_sale_address and token_address

Second paste the token_sale_address hash into the "At Address" field, and switch the contract to the PupperCoinSale contract and press the "At Address" button.

Third past the token_address hash into the "At Address" field, and switch the contract to the PupperCoin contract and press the "At Address" button again.

Next go to the PupperCoinSale contract and open it.
To test it to see if it is working. Put an amount of wei in the Value field and in the PupperCoinSale contract put in an address you want to purchase from and hit enter. If using Metamask it should open and you will need to confirm it. 

If using the Ropsten network, you can check to see if it went through using Etherscan.

To add this custom token to MyCryptoWallet you can open your wallet and follow the instructions listed

Please find example screen shots of successful transactions on the Ropsten Network in the repository.
